# Build-Your-Own-LLM

## Purpose
Most of the LLM foundation models, even if they are called Open, are behind closed doors controlled by the Big Tech. The research community is doing an amazing job to democratize LLMs, with the limited resources at their disposal. This repo is intended to capture the guidance and resources that allow you to build and fine-tune LLMs based on open source.

Please create a pull request if you have something helpful to share.
